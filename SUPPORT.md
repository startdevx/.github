# Support Requests

We encourage a contribution approach through the creation of an issue, a discussion or a pull request on GitHub. If, in some specific cases, you would need a direct support from the author of the repository, you can send your support request via email. The author will evaluate the specificity of the request and come back to you. 

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before any contribution.


Send your support request to kevin@startdevx.com.
