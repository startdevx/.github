## Hey, welcome to Start DevX GitHub organization 👋

Start DevX helps organizations build better engineering cultures through smarter platforms, stronger teams, and meaningful change.

We specialize in platform engineering, developer experience (DevEx), and open-source solutions, combining deep technical expertise with a clear understanding of how people and processes evolve.

Our vision is clear: IT transformation only works when technology and teams move forward together. That’s why we work side by side with delivery, operations, and leadership teams to improve how software is built, deployed, and managed, while guiding the cultural and organizational shifts that make those improvements last.

Whether you need to modernize your CI/CD pipelines, bring internal platforms, or enable greater developer autonomy, Start DevX brings a balanced mix of engineering precision and change management experience to every engagement.
