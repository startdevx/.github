# Contributing to this repository

We welcome your contributions! There are multiple ways to contribute, even if
you're not a developer.

## Opening issues

If you think you've found a security vulnerability, do not open a GitHub issue.
Instead, follow the instructions in our [security policy](./SECURITY.md).

To report a bug or request an enhancement that is not related to a security
vulnerabiliity, open a GitHub issue. When filing a bug, remember that the better
written the bug is, the more easier and more likely it is to be reproduced and
fixed.

3. Create a branch in your fork to implement the changes. We recommend using the issue number as part of your branch name. For example: `1234-fix`
4. Ensure that any documentation is updated with the changes that are required by your change.
5. Submit the pull request. **Do not leave the pull request blank**. Explain exactly what your changes are meant to do and provide simple steps on how to validate your changes. Ensure that you reference the issue you created as well.
6. We will assign the pull request to specific people for review before it is merged.
